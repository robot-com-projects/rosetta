"""Plan-then-fetch video encoder for MCAP bags, mirroring the HDF5 fast path.

``port_bags`` otherwise writes every camera frame to disk as a JPEG so that
``encode_video_frames`` can read it back, and encodes one camera per process. The HDF5
converter avoids both because an HDF5 file is addressable; ``rosbag2_py.SequentialReader``
is not -- one cursor, forward only -- which is why the bag path looked stuck.

It is not: the ``mcap`` library exposes the file's own chunk and message index, so a reader
can filter by topic and seek by log time. That is enough to plan ``row -> log_time`` in one
cheap pass and then fetch frames in parallel.

Two properties of the plan keep the workers simple: log times never decrease within a
segment, so one seek plus a forward walk suffices; and ``hold`` resampling makes consecutive
rows share a log time, so a frame is decoded once and emitted as often as the plan repeats it.

Implements the ``streaming_encoder`` interface ``DatasetWriter`` expects, the same hook the
HDF5 encoder uses.
